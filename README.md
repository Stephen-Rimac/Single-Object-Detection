# Single Object Detection

The attacched notebook contains notes, research and python code for object detection. The code was compiled by [Jeremy Howard](http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy), co-founder of [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai). Many thanks to Jeremy and [Rachel Thomas](http://www.fast.ai/about/#rachel) for building fast.ai and the fastai library, a high-level wrapper for [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org). The following code is based on the [fast.ai libary](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/).
