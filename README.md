# Single Object Detection

The attacched notebook contains notes, research and python code for single object detection. The code was compiled by [Jeremy Howard](http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy), co-founder of [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai). Many thanks to Jeremy and [Rachel Thomas](http://www.fast.ai/about/#rachel) for allowing me to take part as fellow. The following code is based on the [fast.ai libary](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/).
